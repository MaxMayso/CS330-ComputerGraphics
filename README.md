CS - 330 Final Project 3D scene rendering

This project gave me a cool opportunity to build out a full 3D scene from scratch, and honestly, it helped me grow a lot both in how I think about design and how I write code. When I design something like this, 
I usually start by figuring out what pieces I’ll need, and how I can build them using simple shapes. Once I had the basics in place like the pancakes, glass, and lighting, I was able to layer in more details like camera movement and interactivity. 
It definitely wasn’t all smooth sailing, but the trial-and-error made each improvement feel rewarding.

On the development side, I started organizing my code in a cleaner way than I had earlier in the course. I tried to keep everything modular and easy to tweak. 
Testing stuff like camera controls and lighting settings taught me that even small changes can make a big difference in how the scene feels. Overall, this project helped me 
realize how powerful computer graphics can be, and I can definitely see these skills being useful down the line, especially in game dev, UI work, or any kind of interactive visual tool. Plus, it was just fun seeing everything come to life on screen.
